# This is my portfolio

A fairly standard portfolio aiming to be so in a small and aesthetically pleasing package.

## It...
- doesn't have **ANY** javascript
- has it's css embedded in the html to reduce the files transferred
- uses browser safe font-families to save sending one (or many ğŸ™ƒ)
- uses compressed images that still look great
