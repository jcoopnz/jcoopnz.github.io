              This is my current passion project. It's a CRUD app to keep track of your favorite coffee roasts and the recipes you used to brew them. With that record, you can pick up a roast you've had in the past and get the perfect brew. I'm trying to keep things simple while building out the app; with an Angular front-end and an express back-end. I have plans on rebuilding the same app with SvelteKit to explore the differences.

              This is a very simple Angular app to explore different number base systems. Made out of curiosity and a want to practice deployment. As of April 2025, this has had a re-write with the latest v19 Angular.

              This was my final week-long project at Dev Academy. In a group of six, I focused largely on Redux and communication between our server and front-end. It's the most fun I've had frantically hacking at making a Twitter clone from scratch! A real highlight was our implementation to achieve "real-time" feeds which we dubbed "scuffed web-sockets".

              Create pixel art in your GitHub contribution graph! This was my first bigger personal project. Written in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS to challenge the cliche create-react-app. I'm planning on revisiting this with the goal of re-writing to be solely client-side based and then getting it deployed.
